## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- fd1b36b: This version contains a number of big changes!

  My favorite addition is the addition of a `@clarigen/native-bin` package. This removes the need to manually build and specify your local version of the `clarity-cli` binary. Most of this code was taken from the `@blockstack/clarity-native-bin` library. Users on Apple Silicon will also automatically download a pre-built binary (which was not previously available).

  These changes should really improve DX for project setup, as well as the ability to run Clarigen in CI.

  Other changes:

  - **Breaking change** JS types for functions that return `uint` or `int` types now use the `BigInt` native JavaScript type.
    - Although this is a breaking change, this is not a major update. Clarigen is still 0.x and is not in wide use.
  - **Breaking change**: Projects that have a `clarinet` configuration now look for the `Devnet.toml` file (instead of `Development.toml`)
  - Clarity type conversion (between hex and JS) has been consolidated into the `core` library
  - Bug fixes for boolean type conversion for function parameters
  - Added `get-stx-balance` test utility function
  - Added util for getting boot contract identifiers
  - `clarity-cli` is now launched in testnet mode by default
  - Added changesets for better release management
  - Added Github Actions CI to this package
